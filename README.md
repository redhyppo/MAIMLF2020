Metodi di Intelligenza Artificiale e Machine Learning per la Fisica 2020

This repository was created to gather the notebooks I worked on in the class of Metodi di Intelligenza Artificiale e Machine Learning per la Fisica in 2020. I owe credit to @Zdestrion and Forins (who at the time being still has no GitHub account) for the useful collaboration with regards some of the notebooks in this repository.
