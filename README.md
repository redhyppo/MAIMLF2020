Metodi di Intelligenza Artificiale e Machine Learning per la Fisica 2020

This repository was created to gather the notebooks I worked on in the class of Metodi di Intelligenza Artificiale e Machine Learning per la Fisica in 2020. I owe credit to @Zdestrion and Forins (who at the time being still has no GitHub account) for the useful collaboration with regards some of the notebooks in this repository. All the codes upon which the notebooks are based were first created by Professor @stefanogiagu. <br/>
I apologize for having commented the notebooks in Italian. Maybe in the future an English version will be available.
